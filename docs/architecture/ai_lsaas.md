# AI-Powered LSaaS

## What is LSaaS?

Liquid Staking as a Service (LSaaS) is a specialized infrastructure platform that empowers developers to launch Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs) with ease. Conceptually similar to Rollup as a Service (RaaS) — which enables the deployment of scalable Layer 2 solutions — LSaaS focuses on abstracting the complexities of liquid staking protocols into a modular and developer-friendly stack.

StaFi’s LSaaS framework provides a general-purpose, composable infrastructure for building decentralized staking applications across multiple ecosystems.

## About StaFi

StaFi is a pioneering protocol and infrastructure provider in the liquid staking space, designed to unlock the liquidity of staked assets on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains.

Through its LSaaS framework, StaFi supports the creation of Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Re-staking Tokens (LRTs) on networks such as:

- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **EVM-compatible chains**
- **Bitcoin (via Layer 2)**
- **Cosmos**
- **TON**
- **Solana**

By issuing rTokens (e.g., rETH, rBNB, rMATIC), StaFi enables users to earn native staking rewards while preserving liquidity to participate in broader DeFi ecosystems. StaFi currently supports integration with major blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, and Cosmos, bridging the gap between liquidity and security in PoS systems.

## **LSaaS Architecture**

StaFi’s LSaaS architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and upgradeable. It abstracts key functionalities from the Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) industry and introduces innovative mechanisms to support advanced use cases.

**Key Objectives:**

- Simplify the development and deployment of LSTs and LRTs
- Enable seamless DeFi composability
- Ensure long-term scalability and upgradability

**Architecture Layers:**

**Standard Stack:** Provides foundational staking functionalities:

- Stake / Unstake mechanisms
- Real-time reward accrual and distribution

**Modular Extensions:** Advanced components supporting:

- Cross-chain interoperability
- Integration with DeFi protocols
- Custom modules for AI, ZK, and more
