# Future Product
    - G-Vault
        - Intro：A non-custodial, yield-optimized vault focused on opportunities across the 0G ecosystem. Initial vault will be “Intelligent Liquidity Vault” and “Loop Strategy Vault”
            - Intelligent Liquidity Vault: Liquidity is provisioned to DEX pools via Gimo with parameterized range market-making and automated rebalancing. Accrued trading fees and, where applicable, incentives are harvested and auto-compounded to maximize capital efficiency and risk-adjusted returns.
            - Loop Strategy Vault: A suite of capital-efficiency strategies for advanced users. Using OG/stOG as core collateral, the strategies implement collateral–borrow–LP–reinvest loops within the 0G ecosystem
        - Profit: % of the performance fee
    - MEV
        - Intro：Users stake via our infrastructure to mint stOG, earning base staking rewards plus fairly captured MEV. A PBS-style auction on 0G VM routes builder bids to a reward contract for pro-rata distribution to stOG holders, with TEEs providing remote-attested integrity.
            
            
            We will start with an external Searcher Vault to capture begining opportunities and stream profits on-chain to stakers, with a clear path to an in-protocol framework as liquidity and order-flow mature.
            
        - Profits:
            - % of the performance fee that Gimo’s own MEV vault captures
            - % of the prioritiy fee that users pay to the validators
