Token Utilities

- Staking Rewards Distribution — $GIMO is distributed as additional rewards to users who stake via Gimo’s Liquid Staking protocol, reinforcing adoption and deepening TVL.
- Governance Utility — $GIMO holders gain voting power to shape key protocol parameters such as fee models, validator selection, vault configurations, and roadmap priorities, ensuring community-driven growth.
- Fee Capture & Sharing — A portion of staking commissions and vault performance fees flows back to $GIMO stakers/holders, directly linking protocol revenue with token value accrual.
- Liquidity Incentives — $GIMO is used to incentivize liquidity providers for LST trading pairs and G-Vault strategies, strengthening secondary market depth and ensuring efficient composability across DeFi.
- Ecosystem Utility & Expansion — As 0G evolves into an AI-native L1, $GIMO will serve as a utility token across partner dApps, AI-driven financial products, and cross-chain staking opportunities—embedding it as a core asset in the broader AI × DeFi economy.
